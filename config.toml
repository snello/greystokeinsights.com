There was no task too small; she offered creative solutions to the toughest problems, and she did it all with a great attitude. After she left the company - much to my my disappointment - I hired her back as a consultant for a project, and the high level of service continued. She helped us manage a very big project by contributing insights, leading a detailed workshop and delivering a professional product. She is a real asset to any team."
